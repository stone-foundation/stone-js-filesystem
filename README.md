A robust, strongly typed ESM utility for safe, contextual file and path management in Stone.js applications.

---

## Overview

The `@stone-js/filesystem` package is a **pure ESM, strongly typed utility library** that provides safe and contextual file management capabilities for Stone.js applications. It wraps native Node.js APIs with consistent, expressive, and domain-oriented abstractions to handle files, paths, temporary directories, and project-specific structure resolution.

This package is part of the **Stone.js ecosystem**, designed to support the **Continuum Architecture** by exposing a normalized, context-aware interface to filesystem operations across platforms and runtimes.

## Key Features

- File inspection, creation, editing, and movement via the `File` and `UploadedFile` classes
- Utility functions to resolve:
  - `basePath`, `appPath`, `distPath`, `tmpPath`, etc.
- Helpers for hashing, MIME detection, and dynamic imports
- Consistent error handling with `FilesystemError`
- Immutable, encapsulated methods for safety and predictability
- Ideal for use in CLI tools, server runtimes, and adapter layers

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stone-js/filesystem
```

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> This package is **pure ESM**. Ensure your `package.json` includes `"type": "module"` or configure your bundler appropriately.

## Usage

```ts
import { File, basePath, getFileHash } from '@stone-js/filesystem'

const file = File.create(basePath('config', 'app.json'))

if (file.isReadable()) {
  console.log(file.getContent())
}
```
